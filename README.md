# @dworac/typescript-starter

This is a simple and lightweight template for creating new TypeScript projects. The repository includes a basic project structure, configuration files, and some useful tools to get started with writing TypeScript code.


## Usage
Generate a new template by using the following command in your `repos` folder:
```shell
npx @dworac/typescript-template

The npx command will create a new folder with the name of the project and install all dependencies. After the installation is complete, you can start writing your code in the `src` folder.

```shell
cd <project-name>
```
You can now start the development server using the following command:

```sql
yarn start:dev
```
To build the project for production, use the following command:
